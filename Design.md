# DESIGN.md — Next Feature Plan (revised)

## Overview — **Cell-Linked Lists (Bins) for O(N) Neighbor Build** + **Half Neighbor Lists**

We have a working Verlet neighbor list and LJ+PBC kernels. Benchmarks show NL force evaluation overtakes brute force around **N ≈ 256** and scales to **\~46×** at **N = 8192** (ρ=1, rcut=2.5, skin=0.4). However, the **current O(N²) neighbor build** dominates runtime as N grows.
Next, we add a **cell-linked grid** to make neighbor-list construction **O(N)** and switch the production path to a **half list** (store each pair once), halving memory and removing a branch in the kernel.

Scope is tight and non-breaking:

* Add `CellGrid` for cubic periodic boxes.
* Provide `build_cellgrid`, `rebin!`, and `build_neighborlist_cells` (O(N) builder).
* Emit **half neighbor lists** (pair stored once with `j>i`).
* Keep existing APIs; the cell-based builder is an alternative to the current O(N²) builder.

## Public API

```julia
struct CellGrid{IT<:Integer, T<:Real}
    L::T                # box length (CubicBox-compatible)
    cell_size::T        # typically rlist = cutoff + skin
    dims::NTuple{3,IT}  # (nx, ny, nz)
    heads::Vector{IT}   # length = nx*ny*nz; head of linked list per cell (0 = empty)
    next::Vector{IT}    # length = N; next particle index in cell list (0 = end)
end

build_cellgrid(R::AbstractMatrix, box::CubicBox; cell_size::Real) -> CellGrid
rebin!(grid::CellGrid, R::AbstractMatrix, box::CubicBox) -> CellGrid

build_neighborlist_cells(R::AbstractMatrix, box::CubicBox;
                         cutoff::Real, skin::Real=0.3,
                         grid::Union{Nothing,CellGrid}=nothing) -> NeighborList
# Emits a **half list**: each pair appears once with j>i.
```

**Exports (add):**

```julia
export CellGrid, build_cellgrid, rebin!, build_neighborlist_cells
```

Existing exports for `NeighborList`, `build_neighborlist`, `maybe_rebuild!`, `max_displacement_since_build`, `wrap_positions!` remain unchanged.

## Data Structures

```julia
struct CellGrid{IT<:Integer, T<:Real}
    L::T
    cell_size::T                     # enforce cell_size ≤ rlist internally
    dims::NTuple{3,IT}               # ≥ (1,1,1)
    heads::Vector{IT}                # 1-based indices; 0 sentinel
    next::Vector{IT}
end
```

* Linked list per cell avoids allocations during binning.
* `dims = max(1, floor(Int, L/cell_size))` per axis; clamp so `cell_size ≤ rlist`.
* Neighbor search visits the **27 neighboring cells** with periodic wrap.

---

## Algorithms

### A) Build / Rebin Grid — O(N)

1. Compute `(nx,ny,nz)` from `L` and `cell_size`.
2. Zero `heads` (length `nx*ny*nz`) and `next` (length `N`).
3. For each particle `i`, map position to **\[0,L)** then to `(cx,cy,cz)`, linearize to cell id `c`, and push-front: `next[i]=heads[c]; heads[c]=i`.

### B) Build Half Neighbor List from Cells — O(N) at fixed density

* `rlist = cutoff + skin`, precompute `rlist²`.
* For each cell and particle `i` in it:

  * For each of the 27 neighbor cells:

    * For each particle `j` in that cell: **skip if `j ≤ i`** (enforce half list).
    * Compute minimum-image `Δ`; if `‖Δ‖² ≤ rlist²`, record `(i,j)`.
* Assemble CSR: first pass counts → `offsets` (N+1), second pass fills `pairs`.
* Store `ref_positions = copy(R)`.

### C) List-aware LJ Kernel (half list)

Update the NL LJ kernel to **assume each pair appears once (half list)**. Remove runtime `j>i` checks and accumulate both particles’ forces in a single visit:

```
for i in 1:N
  for idx in offsets[i]:(offsets[i+1]-1)
    j = pairs[idx]  # j > i guaranteed by builder
    Δ = R[i,:] - R[j,:]; minimum_image!(Δ, box)
    r2 = dot(Δ,Δ)
    if r2 ≤ cutoff^2
        invr2 = 1/r2
        s2 = (σ^2)*invr2
        s6 = s2^3
        fr_over_r = 24*ϵ*(2*s6^2 - s6)*invr2
        Fi += fr_over_r * Δ
        Fj -= fr_over_r * Δ
        U  += 4*ϵ*(s6^2 - s6) - (shift ? Uc : 0)
    end
  end
end
```

### D) Rebuild Policy

Keep `maybe_rebuild!` (half-skin rule) unchanged. With O(N) builds, users can safely reduce `skin` to improve fidelity without large rebuild penalties.

---

## Numerical Pitfalls

* **Cell size**: enforce `cell_size ≤ rlist` or you risk missing pairs across cells.
* **Tiny boxes / low dims**: `dims` can be `(1,1,1)` → degenerates to O(N²) inside one cell (correct but slower).
* **Precision**: use `Float64` for distance math and accumulators.
* **Geometry guard**: recommend `L > 2*(cutoff+skin)` to avoid ambiguous minimum-image shells.
* **Half-list invariants**: kernel must not double-count; builder guarantees `j>i`.

## Benchmark Guidance (documentation, not a test)

* At **ρ≈1, D=3, rcut=2.5, skin=0.4**:

  * NL force evaluation overtakes O(N²) at **N≈256**.
  * Speedup grows with N: \~3× (512), \~6× (1024), \~23× (4096), \~46× (8192).
* With **O(N) builds**, you may reduce **skin** (e.g., 0.2–0.3) to improve force accuracy without paying a quadratic rebuild cost.

---

## Implementation Notes

* Files:

  * `src/cellgrid.jl`: `CellGrid`, `build_cellgrid`, `rebin!`, helpers (`cell_index`, periodic wrap).
  * `src/neighborlist_cells.jl`: `build_neighborlist_cells` (emits **half list**).
  * `include` both from `src/Verlet.jl`; add exports listed above.
* Ensure **half list** throughout: the cell builder guarantees `j>i`; update the NL LJ kernel to **not** branch on `j>i`.
* Keep distance math and accumulators in `Float64`.
* Enforce `cell_size ≤ rlist` inside `build_cellgrid` to preserve correctness.

---

## Task for Implementer (small & focused)

1. Implement `CellGrid`, `build_cellgrid`, and `rebin!` (O(N) binning) in `src/cellgrid.jl`.
2. Implement `build_neighborlist_cells` that:

   * Uses 27-cell sweep with periodic wrap,
   * Emits a **half list** with `j>i`,
   * Returns a valid CSR `NeighborList` with `ref_positions = copy(R)`.
3. Update `src/Verlet.jl` to include new files and exports.
4. Add `test/test_cellgrid.jl` with the Acceptance Tests and include from `test/runtests.jl`.
5. (Optional) Add `bench/bench_cellgrid_build.jl` to compare O(N²) vs O(N) builds at N∈{256,512,1024,2048}.
