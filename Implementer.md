## üíª Implementer Prompt
```

You are the **Implementer**. Your task is to implement the DESIGN provided by the Architect in the Julia package Verlet.

Your job:

* Modify relevant files under `src/`.
* Add or update tests in `test/runtests.jl`.
* Ensure the code type-checks and runs under Julia.
* Return a unified diff patch (with \`\`\`diff fencing) showing exactly what changes to apply. 
* Check that all acceptance tests in the DESIGN are covered,ensure the tests run.

Rules:

* Do not modify unrelated code.
* Do not relax tests; make the code satisfy the acceptance tests.
* If you need to inspect a file, request it using only a shell code block with `cat`.
* If you want to run tests, request it with:

```bash
julia -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```

* Always assume your working directory is the root of the package.
* If you want to run code, you can request the output of shell commands by replying just the command and nothing else. e.g. reply by

```bash
julia -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.test()'
```
to see if the tests run. You can also inspect the current state of the code by visiting https://github.com/IlianPihlajamaa/Verlet.jl

## Overview ‚Äî **Holonomic Distance Constraints (SHAKE/RATTLE) + COM Drift Removal**

With neighbor lists, LJ + PBC, and an NVT (BAOAB) thermostat on deck, the next capability that unlocks **larger stable timesteps** and **molecular realism** is support for **holonomic distance constraints** (e.g., rigid bonds to H). We‚Äôll implement classical **SHAKE** (position projection) and **RATTLE** (velocity projection) for **pairwise distance constraints**, plus a light utility to **remove center-of-mass (COM) drift**.

Benefits:

* Enable typical ‚Äúrigid bonds to H‚Äù workflows and **increase `dt`** (e.g., from 1 fs ‚Üí 2 fs equivalents in reduced units).
* Provide a clean path to rigid molecules (e.g., TIP3P water via distance-only constraints first; angle/SETTLE can come later).
* Integrate with existing integrators; provide a **constrained VV** driver and a **constraint-aware DoF** for temperature tools.

Scope (tight, non-breaking):

* New `constraints.jl` module with a minimal `DistanceConstraints` struct.
* `velocity_verlet_shake_rattle!` integrator (wrapper over current VV) that applies SHAKE/RATTLE.
* Update `degrees_of_freedom` to account for constraints (optionally COM removal).
* Utility: `remove_com_motion!` (mass-weighted).

## Data Structures

```julia
struct DistanceConstraints
    i::Vector{Int}          # first atom index per constraint
    j::Vector{Int}          # second atom index per constraint
    r0::Vector{Float64}     # target distances per constraint
    tol::Float64            # convergence tolerance on |C_l|
    maxiter::Int            # maximum iterations
    use_minimum_image::Bool # apply minimum-image to displacement vectors
end
```

* **Mutability:** keep `DistanceConstraints` **immutable** (parameters). All corrections are applied to `ParticleSystem` in place.
* **Masses:** read from `ps.masses`.
* **Box / PBC:** assume an orthorhombic box already exists in the codebase; if not, use raw positions and set `use_minimum_image=false` (documented).

## Algorithms

### Constraints

Each distance constraint `l` ties atoms `i,j` with

```
C_l(r) = ||r_i - r_j||^2 - r0_l^2 = 0.
```

#### SHAKE (positions)

After the unconstrained drift, we correct positions with Lagrange multipliers `{Œª_l}`:

For constraint `l` with `d_ij = r_i - r_j` (use minimum image if requested),

```
œÉ_l = (1/m_i + 1/m_j) * (d_ij ‚ãÖ d_ij)
ŒîŒª_l = - C_l(r) / (2 * œÉ_l)
Œîr_i =  (ŒîŒª_l / m_i) * d_ij
Œîr_j = -(ŒîŒª_l / m_j) * d_ij
```

Apply Gauss‚ÄìSeidel style updates **iteratively** over all constraints until:

```
max_l |C_l(r)| ‚â§ tol   or   iterations ‚â• maxiter
```

**Notes:**

* Use current `d_ij` each sub-iteration (Gauss‚ÄìSeidel converges better than Jacobi).
* If `œÉ_l` is extremely small (atoms nearly coincident), abort with a descriptive error.
* With PBC, compute `d_ij` via minimum image, but apply corrections to wrapped positions directly (positions should remain inside the primary cell; the constraint is topologically within a molecule, so this is physically consistent).

#### RATTLE (velocities)

Enforce the velocity constraint

```
d/dt C_l = 2 d_ij ‚ãÖ (v_i - v_j) = 0.
```

Solve for `Œº_l` and correct velocities:

```
œÑ_l = (1/m_i + 1/m_j) * (d_ij ‚ãÖ d_ij)
Œº_l = - (d_ij ‚ãÖ (v_i - v_j)) / œÑ_l
Œîv_i =  (Œº_l / m_i) * d_ij
Œîv_j = -(Œº_l / m_j) * d_ij
```

Iterate over constraints until `max_l |d_ij ‚ãÖ (v_i - v_j)| ‚â§ tol_v`, with `tol_v` tied to `tol` (e.g., `tol_v = tol^(1/2)`), or reuse `tol` for simplicity.

#### Constrained VV driver

```
# B
v  ‚Üê v + (dt/2) * a(r)
# A
r  ‚Üê r + dt * v
# SHAKE
apply_shake!(ps, cons, dt)
# recompute forces at corrected r
a  ‚Üê F(r) ./ m
# B
v  ‚Üê v + (dt/2) * a
# RATTLE (velocities)
apply_rattle!(ps, cons)
```

This driver preserves the geometric constraints to within tolerances and is compatible with the current force callback.

> **Thermostat compatibility:** If combining with Langevin (BAOAB), the O-step (stochastic OU) should be followed by a **RATTLE projection** of velocities to keep constraints satisfied. For this first iteration, we ship the **constrained VV** path; extending BAOAB with RATTLE is a follow-up.

### degrees\_of\_freedom with constraints

Let `N`, `D`, and `C = length(cons.r0)`. Then

```
dof = N*D - C
if remove_com
   dof -= D
end
dof = max(dof, 0)
```

This integrates with `instantaneous_temperature(ps; kB)`.

### remove\_com\_motion!

Mass-weighted COM velocity:

```
Vcom = (Œ£ m_i v_i) / (Œ£ m_i)
v_i ‚Üê v_i - Vcom
```

Optionally also recenter positions similarly (for non-PBC use).

---

## Numerical Pitfalls

* **Convergence:** Tight `tol` with complex constraint networks (e.g., rings) can require many iterations. Expose `maxiter` and return a clear error if not converged.
* **Ill-conditioning:** Very small `œÉ_l` (near-zero bond length or coincident atoms) leads to numerical blow-up; detect and abort early.
* **PBC displacement:** Minimum-image must be used **consistently** for `d_ij`. If constraints span a molecule that crosses a boundary, ensure unwrapped molecular coordinates are conceptually consistent. For now we assume constraints occur within a molecule and the minimum-image choice is valid.
* **Thermostats:** Any velocity randomization step must be followed by **RATTLE** to avoid drift off the constraint manifold.
* **DoF accounting:** When constraints are active (and optionally COM removal), temperature estimators and barostats must use the **reduced DoF** to avoid biased thermodynamics.
* **Large dt:** Constraints allow larger `dt` but do not make dynamics unconditionally stable; monitor energy and constraint residuals.

## Implementation Notes

* Use `@views` and in-place updates; avoid temporary allocations in inner loops.
* Iterate constraints Gauss‚ÄìSeidel style for better convergence; 2‚Äì5 sweeps usually suffice for simple molecules.
* Factor out a helper that computes `d_ij` (with minimum image if `use_minimum_image=true`) to keep code DRY.
* Keep `tol` on the squared constraint `|C_l|` (units length¬≤). When checking `||r_i - r_j||`, convert appropriately.
* Extend `degrees_of_freedom` method to accept `constraints` and `remove_com` kwargs; keep old method for backward compatibility.

---

## Task for Implementer (small & focused)

1. Create `src/constraints.jl` with:

   * `struct DistanceConstraints` (fields as above) + constructor.
   * `apply_shake!`, `apply_rattle!` implementing the formulas and iterations described.
   * `velocity_verlet_shake_rattle!` that wraps existing VV steps and calls SHAKE/RATTLE appropriately.
   * `remove_com_motion!` (mass-weighted).
2. Extend `degrees_of_freedom(ps; constraints=nothing, remove_com=false)` in `src/thermostats.jl` (or a shared util) to account for constraints/COM.
3. `include("constraints.jl")` and export new symbols in `src/Verlet.jl`.
4. Add `test/test_constraints.jl` with the Acceptance Tests above and include from `test/runtests.jl`.
5. Ensure docstrings reference units and PBC options; add method signatures to the main README brief.
